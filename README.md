# Brian TTS Emulator

Simple web app to emulate the Brian donation/cheer voice used by many popular streamers on Twitch. 
<br />
The API in use has been graciously provided by <a href="https://github.com/styler" target="blank_">Styler</a> of StreamElements.

# Disclaimer

This application was not originally developed by me but I've fixed it up a bit and added a decent design to accommodate my OCD.
If you know the original developer of this program, please contact me via Discord so I can give them proper credit.
