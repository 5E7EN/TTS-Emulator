# Brian TTS Emulator

Simple web app to emulate the Brian donation/cheer voice provided by StreamElements on Twitch.

# Disclaimer

This application was not originally developed by me but I've fixed it up a bit and added a decent design to accommodate my OCD.
If you know the original developer of this program, please contact me via Discord so I can give them proper credit.
